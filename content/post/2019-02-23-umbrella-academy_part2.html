<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)</code></pre>
<div id="words-frequency" class="section level1">

<pre class="r"><code>df &lt;- readRDS(&quot;df.RDS&quot;)
df %&gt;%
  unnest_tokens(word, episodes_scripts, token = &quot;sentences&quot;, to_lower = FALSE) </code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 5,830 x 2
