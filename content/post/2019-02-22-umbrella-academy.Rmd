# Why Umbrella Academy ?   

I'm a big fan of [Ellen Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Page) ! I really love her `r emo::ji("heart_eyes")`. [Juno](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0467406/) is one of my favorite movies, no, actually it's even my favorite movie. Besides, the soundtrack is my `r emo::ji("alarm_clock")` `r emo::ji("notes")`.   
So I had to watch this series, and it is awesome ! (Okay, maybe I'm a little biased). I've only seen the first five episodes so far. I'm taking my time because I know I'll be super sad `r emo::ji("sob")` when I'm done with the season. I'll try not to spoil myself too much by analyzing the scripts... challenging !

# Scraping the scripts

To start, load the essential packages **tidyverse** to do everything tidy, **rvest** to scrap web pages and **glue** to make tidy paste. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(glue)
```

Then, [find a web page with the scripts of the series](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=script+umbrella+academy), and put the url in `url`.
```{r}
url <- 'https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/episode_scripts.php?tv-show=the-umbrella-academy-2019&season=1'
```

I played a little with [SelectorGadget](https://selectorgadget.com/) to find the class of what I wanted, `.season-episode-title` seemed a good one, so let's see what it contains :

```{r}
url %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes('.season-episode-title')
```

Good, we can get episodes titles and `href` attribute gives the end the url of each episode, we just have to paste it to "https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/". 

```{r}
#titles of the episodes
episodes_titles <- url %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes('.season-episode-title') %>%
  html_text()

#url of the episodes
episodes_urls <- url %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes('.season-episode-title') %>%
  html_attr("href") %>%
  map(~glue("https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/{.}")) 

```

If you go on [the web page of the first episode for example](https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/view_episode_scripts.php?tv-show=the-umbrella-academy-2019&episode=s01e01), you'll note that the script is in the class `.scrolling-script-container`. So I made a little function to get the script of an episode, then I applied it to the episodes urls list with `map`.

```{r}

#function to get the script of an episode
get_script <- function(url){
  url %>%
    read_html() %>%
    html_nodes(".scrolling-script-container") %>%
    html_text()
}

episodes_scripts <- episodes_urls %>%
  map(~get_script(.))
```

Then I put all in a tibble.

```{r}
df <- tibble(episodes_titles,  episodes_urls, episodes_scripts)
```

Now we have a tidy data frame with all the scripts...
